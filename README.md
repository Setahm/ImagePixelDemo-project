>ImagePixelDemo is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates two independent image features:
- `PictureBox1`: Allows manual pixel manipulation using a simple color inversion filter. You can load a single image and apply the filter step-by-step.
- `PictureBox2`: Displays a slideshow of multiple images. You can load a set of images and start/stop the animation to cycle through them automatically.
